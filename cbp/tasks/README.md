# Tasks

So, what is a task?

Well, a task is an action taken..

a task is work that is to be performed.

Without the concept of a "task", the system would not change.

## What is a conceptual task in CBP

Well, it, along with a "type" are the atomic units of the CBP system.

They can be performed by mechanisms. What is a mechanism.

*An arrangement of parts that work together to produce a desired motion or effect.*

*..they can be found in all sorts of machines and devices from simple like a can-opener to complex*

* Need a database of tasks (this is the code-chain.. isn't it)
  * contains links to source and cached byte-code/binaries if available
  * has a definiton with focus on i/o types
  * uid and label
  * networked sub-tasks, if composite node

**Tasks are recipes for "task-generators" needed for networked, system integration**

In the orientation of graph theory, the task is the node and the i/o connection to other tasks is the edge (using e.g. zmq socket list).
